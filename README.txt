CleanAF — Desktop Cleaner & Organizer (Windows)
Version: 1.0.0
Build date: 2025-10-26

What it does
- Cleans your Desktop in one click.
- Keeps system icons (Recycle Bin, This PC) and the app itself.
- Moves the rest to a folder named "Current Desktop" (adds a timestamp if it already exists).
- Auto-sorts files into folders like PDF, Word, Images, etc.

How to use (no install)
1) Extract this ZIP anywhere (Desktop is fine).
2) Double‑click "CleanAF.bat".
   - If Windows shows a warning, click "More info" → "Run anyway".

Notes
- No internet required. No data leaves your machine.
- If you run it multiple times, it makes a new timestamped "Current Desktop" each time.
- Duplicate names are auto-numbered safely.
